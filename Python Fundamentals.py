# Python Fundamentals

# 1. Hello World Program: Write and run a simple program that prints Hello, World! (Chapter 2).
print("Hello, World!")

# 2. Working with Lists: Create a list of your favorite hobbies and print each one using a for loop.
hobbies = ["Reading", "Cooking", "Drawing", "Gaming", "Fashion"]
print("My favorite hobbies are:")

# Modify the list by adding, removing, and sorting the items using list methods (e.g., append(), pop(), sort().

# Adding a hobby.
hobbies.append("Traveling")
print(hobbies)

# Removing a hobby.
hobbies.pop(4)
print(hobbies)

# Sorting the list.
hobbies.sort()
print(hobbies)
